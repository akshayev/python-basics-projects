# Python Basics - Data Engineering Journey

## About
This repository contains my daily Python practice projects as I learn data engineering from scratch.

## Projects

### Day 1: Freelance Pay Calculator
**File:** `d1 The Freelancer Pay Calculator.py`

A simple calculator that computes freelancer payments with tax deductions.

**Features:**
- Takes freelancer name, hourly rate, and hours worked as input
- Calculates gross payment
- Applies 10% tax deduction
- Displays detailed payment breakdown

**Skills Practiced:**
- User input handling
- Data type conversion (float)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- F-string formatting
- Variable manipulation

### Day 2: Bank Loan Validator
**File:** `d2_The Bank Loan Validator.py`

A loan validation system that checks customer eligibility based on financial rules.

**Features:**
- Takes customer name, income, credit score, and loan amount as input
- Validates loan approval (income >= 30000 AND credit score >= 700)
- Identifies high-risk applicants (income <= 20000 OR credit score <= 600)
- Calculates processing fees and monthly EMI
- Generates formatted financial report

**Skills Practiced:**
- Typecasting (int, float)
- Arithmetic operations (percentages, division)
- String manipulation with f-strings and escape characters (\n, \t)
- Comparison operators (>=, <=, <, >)
- Boolean logic (and, or operators)
- Complex conditional rules

### Day 3: Simple Calculator
**File:** `d3_calculator.py`

A basic arithmetic calculator that performs operations based on user input.

**Features:**
- Takes operator choice (+, -, *, /)
- Takes two numbers as input
- Performs the selected arithmetic operation
- Displays result or error for invalid operator

**Skills Practiced:**
- User input handling
- Conditional statements (if/elif/else)
- Multiple conditions and branching logic
- Error handling with else clause
- Operator selection based on user input

## Skills Summary
**Data Processing (Operations)**
- Typecasting: Converting raw input into numeric types
- Arithmetic: Mathematical calculations including percentages
- String Manipulation: Formatting output with f-strings and escape characters

**Logic & Rules**
- Comparison Operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=
- Boolean Logic: and, or, not for multi-condition checks

## Tech Stack
